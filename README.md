## Open first company

Arawa is a service company providing advices, integration, specific development, hosting and support for free and open source solutions. The core business focuses on collaboration and communication productivity tools.

Our team is spread across the globe (France/Belgium for now) but all speak French.

Arawa means libre/free in [Hittite language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language), therefore we are an open first company.
